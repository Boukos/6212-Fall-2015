## Course Details

### Website: https://github.com/GWU-KIM-CSCI/6212-Fall-2015

### Textbook

* *Optional*: "Introduction to Algorithms (Third Edition)" Cormen, Leiserson, Rviest, Stein - The MIT Press

### Grading

* 30% - Quizes
* 35% - Closed-book Midterm
* 35% - Closed-book Final
* 5% - Optional Project

### Homeworks

There will be homework assignments every week. However, they are not graded. They are purely optional.
However, I highly recommend doing them. It will greatly help you towards the midterm and final. The answers
to the homework will be posted week before the midterm and the final. Homework will be posted on the website.

### Make-up Exam/Quiz

No make-up exam/quiz will be given except for documented illness or personal emergency. The instructor must be notified at least day PRIOR to the scheduled exam time in order for a make-up exam to be granted. A 15-minute quiz will be given at the beginning of class (12:45-1:00pm). You should arrive in class on time. No make up for missed quizes.

### Lecture slides

Lecture slides will be posted to the website prior to each lecture.
