    1. Write the Insertion algorithm for BST.
    
    2. You are given two arrays L1 and L2, each with n keys sorted in increasing order.
       For simplicity, you may assume that the keys are all distinct from each other.
    
       a. Describe an O(log n) time algorithm to find the nth smallest of the 2n keys.
       b. Describe an O(log n) time algorithm to find the (n/2)th smallest (i.e., the median) of the 2n keys
          assuming that n is even
    
    3. Given set, S, of n numbers and a number x
    
        a. Design an O(n log n) time algorithm to determine whether
           there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.
        b. Suppose S is in sorted order, design an O(n) algorithm to solve 4a.
 
    
    4. Use the master theorem to give the tight asymptotic bound for the following functions:
    
        a. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + 1
        b. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^(1/2)
        c. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n
        d. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^2
